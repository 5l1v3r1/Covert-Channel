# Covert-Channel

Objective: To become familiar with covert channels and to design a covert channel using the TCP/IP protocol suite.

Constraints:
- Your technique for embedding covert data into the headers must be one that is not covered
by any of the techniques in the paper.
- You may only use the TCP, UDP, or IP headers for this exercise.
- You are required to show all the data supporting the success (or lack thereof) of your data embedding scheme.
